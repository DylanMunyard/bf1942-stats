# üèÜ BF1942 Gamification System

A comprehensive achievement and badge system for BF1942 stats tracking.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Create ClickHouse Tables
Run the SQL commands in `../Migrations/clickhouse-gamification.sql` in your ClickHouse instance:

```bash
# Connect to ClickHouse and run:
clickhouse-client --query "$(cat Migrations/clickhouse-gamification.sql)"
```

### 2. Start the System
The gamification system will automatically start with the main application. It includes:
- **Background Service**: Processes new achievements every 5 minutes
- **API Endpoints**: Access achievements and leaderboards
- **Incremental Processing**: Only processes new data since last run

### 3. Initial Historical Processing (Optional)
To process existing historical data for achievements:

```bash
# Trigger historical processing via API (admin endpoint)
POST /api/gamification/admin/process-historical
```

## üìä Achievement Types

## üîó API Endpoints

### Player Achievements
```bash
# Get all achievements for a player
GET /api/gamification/player/{playerName}

# Get recent achievements (last 30 days)
GET /api/gamification/player/{playerName}/recent?days=30&limit=20

# Get specific achievement type
GET /api/gamification/player/{playerName}/kill_streak
GET /api/gamification/player/{playerName}/badge
GET /api/gamification/player/{playerName}/milestone

# Check if player has specific achievement
GET /api/gamification/player/{playerName}/has/{achievementId}
```

### Leaderboards
```bash
# Get kill streak leaderboard
GET /api/gamification/leaderboard/kill_streaks?limit=100

# Get achievements leaderboard
GET /api/gamification/leaderboard/achievements?period=monthly&limit=50
```

### Badge Information
```bash
# Get all available badges
GET /api/gamification/badges

# Get badges by category
GET /api/gamification/badges/performance
GET /api/gamification/badges/milestone
GET /api/gamification/badges/social
```

### Admin Endpoints
```bash
# Process historical data
POST /api/gamification/admin/process-historical?fromDate=2024-01-01

# Trigger incremental processing
POST /api/gamification/admin/process-incremental

# Get system stats
GET /api/gamification/stats
```

## ‚ö° Performance Features

### Incremental Processing
- Only processes new `player_rounds` data since last run
- Uses `MAX(processed_at)` timestamp to track progress
- No reprocessing of historical records

### Optimized Calculations
- **Kill Streaks**: Single-round only (no cross-round complexity)
- **Milestones**: Threshold detection on new rounds
- **Performance Badges**: Calculated using recent round windows
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple achievements stored in single ClickHouse operation

### Caching Strategy
- Badge definitions cached in memory
- Recent player data cached for performance calculations
- Leaderboards can be cached with TTL

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

```
GamificationService (main orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ KillStreakDetector (real-time single-round streaks)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MilestoneCalculator (threshold crossing detection)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PerformanceBadgeCalculator (KPM, KD badges)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ClickHouseGamificationService (data operations)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BadgeDefinitionsService (badge metadata)
```

## üìà Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive logging:
- Achievement processing statistics
- Performance metrics
- Error handling and recovery
- Historical processing progress

Check application logs for gamification processing information.

## üîß Configuration

Key environment variables:
- `CLICKHOUSE_URL`: ClickHouse connection URL for gamification data

The system uses the same ClickHouse instance as the main stats system and automatically configures itself based on existing settings.
